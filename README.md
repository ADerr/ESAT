ESAT
====

The ESAT toolkit is designed for expression analysis of Digital expression (DGE) libraries that target transcript "ends". ESAT takes a set of alignment files (SAM or BAM) with genome alignment coordinates, a file containing transcript coordinates (BED or text file) and outputs read counts for each transcript provided.

See http://garberlab.umassmed.edu/software/esat/ for a detailed manual.
